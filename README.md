About Me
Good afternoon! My name is [Andreassa](https://x.com/VorobeyAnd), and I am interested in participating as a node operator \ validator in your project. I bring a wealth of experience from participating in dozens of projects across various ecosystems and purposes.

Technical Expertise
Scripting: I specialize in writing scripts in lightweight, non-complex languages. These scripts include tools for tracking my validators and sending real-time notifications to Telegram via bots. I develop and maintain these tools independently, ensuring quick detection and resolution of any operational issues.

Problem Solving: With extensive experience, I am adept at solving most problems independently. When needed, I provide detailed feedback to the team to improve processes and enhance system reliability.

Community Engagement
Communication: I am proactive and enjoy engaging with others in community chat forums. I find it rewarding to assist others, contributing to the growth and popularity of projects through active participation and support.
